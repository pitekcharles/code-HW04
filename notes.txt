lets go with ?? questions, 60 sec timer.

going to need questions:

var questions = [

    choices: ["strings", "booleans", "alerts", "numbers"],
    answer: "alerts"
  },

    title: "The condition in an if / else statement is enclosed within ____.",
    choices: ["quotes", "curly brackets", "parentheses", "square brackets"],
    answer: "parentheses"
  },
  {
      title: "Famous titles"
      choices: ["Dolly Parton", "Your mother", ]
      answer: "Dolly Parton"

  {
      title: "Pick a number, any number and you win."
      choices: ["V", "dog", "moo", "5"]
      answer: "5"
  }
